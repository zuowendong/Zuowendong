It takes all sorts to make a world. 世界之大，无奇不有

Be bold. You don't have so many audiences. 大胆点生活，其实你没有那么多观众。

Succcessful, faster runs my horse in vernal breeze;I've seen within one day all flowers on the trees. 春风得意马蹄疾，一日看尽长安花。

It is never too late to fall in love. 爱永远不会嫌晚。

Remember to bring a little smile every day in this messy life. 记得在这杂乱的生活里每天带点笑意。

When the Cang-lang's waters are clear,I can wash my hat-strings in them. 沧浪之水清兮，可以濯吾缨。

It is worthwhile to travel all over the world. 遍历山河，人间值得。
